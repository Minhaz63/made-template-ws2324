# Project Plan
The main Goal of the project is to find the relation of road accident and the temparature because in recent times the road accident has incresed and the aim is to find the relation between temparature and the rate of the accident.
## Title
<!-- Give your project a short title. -->
Relation between temparture and the rate of road accident

## Main Question

<!-- Think about one main question you want to answer based on the data. -->
1. The changes of the temparature
2. How the rate of road accident increasing day by day?


## Description

<!-- Describe your data science project in max. 200 words. Consider writing about why and how you attempt it. -->
I will try to find the dataset and make some preprocessing such as removing null values, i have the data of average temparature daily and I have the monthly data of accident, so I have to make it average and see the changes of temparature and the changes of road accident and see the relations

## Datasources

<!-- Describe each datasources you plan to use in a section. Use the prefic "DatasourceX" where X is the id of the datasource. -->
